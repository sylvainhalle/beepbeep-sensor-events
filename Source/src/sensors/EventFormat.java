/**
 * The purpose of the {@link EventFormat} class is to manipulate sensor events
 * at a level of abstraction that hides the superficial differences in the file
 * formats across multiple datasets. It assumes that events in a dataset have
 * the following features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A <em>state</em>, which corresponds to a single value or reading
 * produced by a sensor at a given moment</li> 
 * <li>A <em>timestamp</em> that determines the time at which
 * a specific state reading has been produced</li>
 * <li>An <em>index</em>, which corresponds to the position of the
 * event in the physical ordering of the input source</li>
 * <li>Two attributes specifying the placement of the sensor in the
 * environment:<ul>
 *   <li>The <em>location</em>, which is the broad area (e.g. room) where the
 *   sensor is located</li>
 *   <li>The <em>subject</em>, which is the particular element (e.g. bedhead,
 *   stove, door) that the sensor is observing</li> 
 *   </ul></li>
 * <li>A <em>model</em>, which is the physical device producing the reading</li>
 * <li>The name of the <em>sensor</em> on the device that produces the
 * reading</li>
 * </ul>
 * It is further assumed that these last four attributes are nested within each
 * other (i.e. for a given <em>location</em>, the value of <em>subject</em>
 * uniquely defines a subject; for a given <em>location</em>-<em>subject</em>
 * pair, the value of <em>model</em> uniquely defines a physical device, etc.).
 * <p>
 * All returned functions take as input an event of a specific type, and
 * extract various features from this event.
