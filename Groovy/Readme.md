Groovy examples for the sensor toolkit
======================================

This folder contains examples of scripts in the Groovy programming language
showcasing the various capabilities of the sensor processing library. Emphasis
is made on the expressiveness (i.e. complexity) of the processing involved, as
weel as the relative succinctness of the resulting scripts --thanks to the
high-level templates provided by the library, and BeepBeep's intrinsically
modular nature.
